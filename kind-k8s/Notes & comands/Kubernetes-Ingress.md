# Kubernetes Ingress

Ingress exposes multiple services externally through a single entry point using HTTP/HTTPS. Instead of giving every service its own NodePort or LoadBalancer, you define routing rules — by path or hostname — and let the Ingress Controller handle the rest.

---

## How it Works

```
User → Ingress Controller → Ingress Rules → Service → Pods
```

Ingress never talks to Pods directly — it always forwards to a Service. The Ingress resource is just the routing config. The **Ingress Controller** is the actual component that reads those rules and handles incoming traffic. Without a controller deployed in the cluster, the Ingress YAML does nothing.

Common controllers: NGINX (most widely used), Traefik, HAProxy, and cloud-managed ones on EKS/GKE/AKS.

## Ingress vs NodePort vs LoadBalancer

| Feature            | NodePort | LoadBalancer | Ingress |
| ------------------ | -------- | ------------ | ------- |
| External access    | Yes      | Yes          | Yes     |
| Multiple services  | No       | No           | Yes     |
| Path/host routing  | No       | No           | Yes     |
| HTTPS/TLS          | No       | No           | Yes     |
| Cost at scale      | High     | Very high    | Low     |

Ingress only handles HTTP/HTTPS (Layer 7). For raw TCP/UDP you'd need something else like MetalLB or a LoadBalancer service.

## Install NGINX Ingress Controller (KIND)

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/main/deploy/static/provider/kind/deploy.yaml

# wait for it to be ready
kubectl wait --namespace ingress-nginx \
  --for=condition=ready pod \
  --selector=app.kubernetes.io/component=controller \
  --timeout=90s
```

## Example 1 — Path-Based Routing

Route `/student` and `/admin` to different services on the same domain.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: app-ingress
  namespace: myspace
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx
  rules:
    - http:
        paths:
          - path: /student
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: student-service
                port:
                  number: 80
          - path: /admin
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: admin-service
                port:
                  number: 80
```

The `rewrite-target: /` annotation strips the path prefix before forwarding to the service — without it, your app receives `/student/...` instead of just `/...`.

---

## Example 2 — Host-Based Routing

Different subdomains routed to different services. More common in production than path-based routing.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: host-ingress
  namespace: myspace
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx
  rules:
    - host: student.example.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: student-service
                port:
                  number: 80
    - host: admin.example.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: admin-service
                port:
                  number: 80
```

For local testing, add these to `/etc/hosts`:

```
127.0.0.1  student.example.com
127.0.0.1  admin.example.com
```

## Example 3 — TLS / HTTPS

Create a self-signed cert, store it as a Secret, and reference it in the Ingress.

```bash
# generate self-signed cert
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \
  -keyout tls.key -out tls.crt \
  -subj "/CN=student.example.com"

# create the TLS secret
kubectl create secret tls student-tls \
  --cert=tls.crt --key=tls.key \
  -n myspace
```

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: tls-ingress
  namespace: myspace
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx
  tls:
    - hosts:
        - student.example.com
      secretName: student-tls
  rules:
    - host: student.example.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: student-service
                port:
                  number: 80
```

## Backing Services and Deployments

Both examples above assume these exist in `myspace`:

```yaml
# student-service
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: student-service
  namespace: myspace
spec:
  selector:
    app: student
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
  type: ClusterIP

---
# student deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: student
  namespace: myspace
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: student
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: student
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: student
          image: nginx:alpine
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
```

---

## Commands

```bash
# list ingress resources
kubectl get ingress -n myspace

# inspect routing rules and events
kubectl describe ingress app-ingress -n myspace

# check ingress controller pods
kubectl get pods -n ingress-nginx

# check controller logs if traffic isn't routing
kubectl logs -n ingress-nginx -l app.kubernetes.io/component=controller
```

---

## Notes

- Always set `ingressClassName: nginx` — without it, newer clusters won't know which controller to use
- The `rewrite-target` annotation is easy to forget on path-based routing and will cause 404s in your app
- In production, use cert-manager instead of manually creating TLS secrets — it handles renewals automatically
- Ingress is HTTP/HTTPS only — for TCP or UDP traffic, use a `LoadBalancer` service or configure TCP proxying in the NGINX controller config
